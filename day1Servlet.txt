servelet platform and server independent
dyanamically generate response


                           
service is responsible for doget and doPost methods
becoz of that we cannot override Service method in HTTPServelt
HttpServlet methods:
GET, HEAD, PUT, POST, DELETE, OPTIONS and TRACE


init, service,destroy,getservletinfo
getservletConfig()
in servlet interface
u override it in generic servlet except service method
generic is a abstract class


1 context per web application
context created by container immediately
when app is deployed

when we invoke the servlet ServeltConfig is created by ServletContainer
init-initializing values of all data

getServeltContext
getServeltConfig
we can use in our pg


doget doget service
throws IO and Servelt Exception

Request parameters:
The ServletRequest (or HttpServletRequest object if using HttpServlet) contains a lot of
information. We shall see how servlet processes form parameters.
public String ServletRequest.getParameter (String name): This returns the
value of the named parameter as a String or null if parameter wasn’t specified.
public String[] ServletRequest.getParameterValues (String name): It returns
values of named parameter as a String array if parameter could have multiple
values, as in the case of list element with multiple select.
public Enumeration ServletRequest.getParameterNames(): It returns a list of
parameter names.
public String ServletRequest.getQueryString(): It returns the raw query string of
the request.


String filename = request.getPathTranslated()
This method returns the extra path information translated to a real file system path or
null if there is no extra path information.

server can send 3 things to client:
1.status code 2.any no of HTTP response header 3. response body

Status Codes:
-A Servlet can use the setStatus() method to set response status code.
-A servlet can use sendError(int sc) (sc indicates the
status code to indicate error during handling of request.
-Status codes are three-digit integer values, the first digit of which specifies one
of five classes of response. So we have 1xx: Informational, 2xx: Success, 3xx:
Redirection, 4xx: Client Error, and 5xx: Server Error.
-SC_OK for status code 200 and SC_NOT_FOUND for
status code 404!




A call to setHeader() that tells the client to reload this same
servlet after showing its current content for three seconds:
setHeader(“Refresh”, “3” );
setHeader(“Refresh”, “3;URL=https://ispace.igate.com”);


Methods for setting arbitrary response headers are as follows:
The setHeader( String name, String value ) method sets the value
of the named header as a string. For example:
res.setHeader(“Location”, new_location);
Use the setDateHeader( String name, long date ) method, if there
is a need to specify a timestamp for a header. It sets the value of
the named header with the given name and date-value
Use the setIntHeader( String name, int value) method to specify
an integer value for a header
The containsHeader() method returns a boolean indicating
whether the named response header has already been set
Other than these methods, there are some additional methods to set
response headers:
setContentType: Sets the Content- Type header
setContentLength: Sets the Content- Length header
addCookie: Adds a value to the Set- Cookie header
sendRedirect: Changes status code to redirection i.e. 300 and a specifies the client to request another page

sendRedirect Adds name of page in URl
